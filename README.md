Rate My Schedule
----------------
Rate My Schedule is web app that allows you to get feedback on your school schedule. Users enter in the classes they are taking and based off what other users have said, a rating is given to the user (out of 10) that tells them the difficulty of their schedule. Users can also read and write reviews about classes for others to read to get better insight on classes they may be interested in taking. Users can also recommend classes to other who are taking classes similar to what they have taken.
